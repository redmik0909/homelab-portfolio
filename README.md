# Homelab Infrastructure Portfolio

This repository documents my enterprise-style homelab infrastructure built to practice real-world system administration, networking, security, automation, and monitoring.

## Core Stack
- OPNsense firewall with multi-interface network segmentation
- Proxmox VE virtualization (VMs & LXC containers)

- Implemented automated backup strategy with retention policies
- Built full monitoring stack (Grafana + Prometheus + Uptime Kuma)
- Automated infrastructure management workflows

## Documentation Structure
- Network architecture & firewall design
- Virtualization environment
- Storage & backup strategy
- Security implementation
- Automation workflows
- Hosted services
- Troubleshooting & lessons learned

This project reflects hands-on experience solving real infrastructure challenges.
